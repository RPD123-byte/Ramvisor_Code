Based on the provided information, the required courses for the Economics Major, B.S. (ECON) and the Computer Science Major, B.S. (COMP) are specified within the sample plans of study. Let's start by identifying the courses required for each major and then create a full schedule for the double major.

In the case of:

Economics Major, B.S. (ECON):
- ECON 101: Introduction to Economics
- ECON 400: Introduction to Data Science and Econometrics
- ECON 410: Intermediate Microeconomics
- ECON 420: Intermediate Macroeconomics
