       " \"Department of Anthropology (ANTH) (BS, BA, Minor) - Introduction: Anthropology is the integrative study of human beings at all times and in all places. Anthropological expertise has special application for hidden histories and the ancient past; the intersection of human biology and ecology; and the way communities create and use meaning, values, and history in everyday life. We support studies, research, and professional applications in these areas with three programs of foundational training: archaeology; human biology, ecology, and evolution; and sociocultural anthropology. Cutting across these specializations, the department supports concentrations that integrate anthropology's diverse expertise to address contemporary world problems. Programming in these areas helps students connect their anthropological studies to work and life beyond the University. Current concentrations focus on health, medicine, and humanity; heritage and unwritten histories; global engagement; race, place and power; and food, environment, and sustainability. Together, the Department of Anthropology's programs and concentrations offer the undergraduate student one of the best introductions possible to our biological and cultural pasts and to our contemporary world. Anthropology majors thus develop the written and oral skills needed to live and work in a complex world marked by an accelerated rate of environmental, social, and cultural change. Anthropology majors acquire general knowledge and skills valued within a large number of occupations and professions, including but not limited to professional anthropology.\",\n",

The resources and professional staff of University Career Services and the department's director of undergraduate studies can provide guidance. • Anthropology majors can seek a career that puts their anthropology degree directly into practice. • Lastly, anthropology majors can continue with graduate education in order to seek a career in education, either as a social studies teacher in a school or a professor in a university.

Our thesis writers work closely with a faculty advisor and committee members to develop their project. The department provides excellent support, offering a specific seminar during the fall (ANTH\\xa0691H) and a corresponding independent study (ANTH\\xa0692H), that together walk students through the essential steps of research design and writing. For our students, writing an honors thesis continues to prove a pivotal experience—at once a capstone to their studies at Carolina and an achievement to carry with them into their lives and careers beyond. To pursue an honors thesis project, students must: • Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.3 from the spring semester of\\xa0the junior\\xa0year through the entirety of the senior year • Secure a faculty advisor who is an anthropologist at UNC-Chapel Hill. • Successfully complete the ANTH\\xa0691H and ANTH\\xa0692H sequence • Receive approval from UNC's Office for Human Research Ethics prior to the start of research, for all projects involving human subjects The process for approval requires several steps: • Students considering an honor thesis should first contact the director of undergraduate studies or the honors thesis seminar instructor, during their junior year (or earlier). • Eligible students next should secure an advisor prior to enrolling in ANTH\\xa0691H for the fall semester of their senior year. Typically, the advisor is a professor that they have worked with in a class or faculty member with shared interests. • In the fall students develop their research design and begin to write their thesis ANTH\\xa0691H. • In the spring, students complete an independent study with their advisor, focusing on writing the thesis ANTH\\xa0692H. Students also form their committee, by adding two additional faculty members. • To complete the process, students defend (i.e., present and discuss) their thesis to their committee.\",\n",

Historical, environmental, and comparative components enable the examination of different culture systems through time and space, as well as the reconstruction of past lifeways and the interpretation of ancient social, political, and economic systems. The geographic scope of the program includes the Americas, Europe and the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East. The educational goal of the program is to provide the student with a component of a liberal arts education that draws on both the social sciences and the humanities. It also will effectively prepare students for graduate study in anthropological archaeology, Mediterranean archaeology, museology, and historical preservation, or careers in contract archaeology and cultural resource management. Students interested in applying to graduate programs in Mediterranean or Near Eastern archaeology may need ancient language classes not required for the major.

Developing an understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology requires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach effectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow students to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand important aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in archaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the Study Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology, classics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research associates offer laboratory experiences through independent study projects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are designed to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work as assistants to field archaeologists and specialists—such as surveyors, archaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists, biological anthropologists, and geomorphologists—learning firsthand various aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation associated with archaeological field projects.',\n",

       " 'Department of Art and Art History (ARTH) (BS, BA, Minor) - Introduction: The Department of Art and Art History at UNC–Chapel Hill fosters exchange among creative endeavor, scholarly investigation, and bold expression, through faculty research, graduate student training, undergraduate programs, and public events. The department aims to be an integral part of the University community dedicated to free inquiry that is pursued through both the arts and sciences and expressed in objects, images and text. Through an innovative and rigorous curriculum, students learn the critical skills of creative problem solving and self-expression. The undergraduate programs aim to help students articulate their individual perspectives on values and beliefs while discovering their places in a society that is increasingly shaped by visual communications, technology, and globalization. To do so, students develop their creative and scholarly vision and the technical skills to express that vision through their works of art and writing. The highly rated graduate programs in art history and studio art promote these ideals on an advanced level, and have proven their effectiveness through the post-graduate placement and national awards that students receive. •  Mission:  Make | Frame | Reveal •  Vision:  Thinking and Creating across Boundaries •  Values:  The curiosity, empathy, and courage to engage diverse perspectives As a department, we are committed to working closely with our students and to guiding them in developing an individual voice. We cultivate exchange between studio art and art history and offer maximum flexibility within our individual programs. Majors and minors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance, cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions, enabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a variety of social contexts. The studio art program offers three different degree programs for majors as well as a minor, and each encourages experimentation, crossing boundaries, and hybrid processes as well as engaging the history and traditions of art. Through directed practice and creative research, faculty work closely with students to stimulate aesthetic and intellectual inquiry, impart portable skills, and motivate self-exploration to help students create outstanding works of art. Students may choose from a range of studio coursework designed to develop both skills and a personal creative vision. Students develop two critical skills: the means of self-expression and techniques for creative thinking. While the undergraduate program focuses on the fine arts, the course of study nonetheless offers a sound foundation for students to move into art education, design fields, and other art-related careers as well as preparation for further study or careers in the fine arts.',\n",

Students who pass the AP portfolio exam for 2-D Design, 3-D Design or Drawing with a score of 4 or 5 receive placement for ARTS\\xa0102, ARTS\\xa0103, or ARTS\\xa0104\\xa0respectively. Students earning a score of 6 or higher on the IB portfolio receive placement for ARTS\\xa0104. Placement effectively means that students can waive ARTS 102, 103 or 104 prerequisites.Students who score a 3 on AP portfolios or 5 on the IB may petition for a portfolio review to determine if they can waive\\xa0ARTS\\xa0102\\xa0or\\xa0ARTS\\xa0104\\xa0requirements. In addition to these threshold scores, art majors who have broad experience in visual art may petition to waive some prerequisites by submitting a portfolio for review. If the review is successful, students receive placement only. Students then substitute any other ARTS coursework to satisfy the total credit hours required in\\xa0the major. Portfolio requirements are modeled after the College Board Advanced Placement portfolios. These guidelines are available from the director of undergraduate studies in studio art, the student services specialist, or on the art majors' Sakai site. Portfolios are reviewed annually in September only. Contact the director of 114  Department of Art and Art History undergraduate studies in studio art at the beginning of the fall semester to make arrangements for submitting a portfolio.\",\n",

Students are strongly encouraged to attend such sessions since questions of collective relevance often arise.\\xa0 Basic details are also posted on the majors' Sakai site. Additionally, special information sessions are held periodically to guide students on awards, study abroad, internships, and research opportunities (especially the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships). These sessions are announced via the majors' listserv and on the majors' Sakai site, as well as by posters in the Hanes Art Center and Art Lab.\",\n",
       " 'Department of Art and Art History (ARTH) (BS, BA, Minor) - Course Enrollment and Audit Policies - Studio Art: During the fall and spring semester registration periods, enrollment in studio art (ARTS) courses is temporarily restricted to students who have declared a major or minor in studio art to ensure that the students can graduate in a timely manner. Students who are not part of the studio art program will have the opportunity to enroll only when the restriction period has ended — no exceptions. Please refer to the \"Notes\" section in ConnectCarolina ARTS course listings to determine restriction dates established by the department. Major and minor enrollment restrictions do not apply to the following types of ARTS courses: Honors, Carolina Courses Online, or First-Year Seminars. \\xa0 Unfortunately, ARTS courses cannot be audited by current students or members of the community. This is due to the participatory nature of studio courses and finite resources, which includes classroom space and potential safety hazards associated with overcrowding.

       " \"Art History Major, B.A. (ARTH): The undergraduate program in art history is directed toward two main educational goals: 1. to provide students with an excellent liberal arts foundation through an understanding of the historical and global significance, cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions from prehistoric times to the present; and 2. to provide these students with the intellectual tools needed to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a variety of social contexts. Skills in visual analysis, historical research, critical reading, analytical and descriptive writing, and oral communication are developed throughout the course of the study. The practice of art history is interdisciplinary, dynamically engaged with many fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as with the University's diverse area studies programs and the Ackland Art Museum. The art history major equips students with skills, knowledge, and values to negotiate rapidly changing, richly diverse, and increasingly interconnected local, national, and worldwide communities.\",\n",

Such work may be undertaken  only  with the permission of the sponsoring faculty member. Students should consult individual faculty members prior to registration to secure permission. A proposal and a contract must be approved by the appropriate director of undergraduate studies (studio art or art history) before students may enroll. (See the Undergraduate Policies, Procedures, and Resources (https://art.unc.edu/about/policies/undergraduate-policies-procedures- and-resources/) section of the Department of Art and Art History website (https://art.unc.edu/) for instructions.) Since faculty members are limited to supervising only two independent study students each semester, students are strongly advised to contact the faculty member with whom they wish to work early in the registration period for the upcoming semester. Independent study work requires a minimum of three hours per week per credit hour. For example, a typical three-credit-hour class would require at least nine hours of work per week. Once the semester begins, students must meet with the faculty member initially to confirm goals, review expectations, and establish semester deadlines. Thereafter, students must meet regularly to review work in progress, with a suggested biweekly frequency. Total time spent in direct interaction with the faculty member for the semester must average 45 minutes per week.

There are several undergraduate student organizations serving the visual arts at Carolina. The Undergraduate Art Association (UAA) is a campuswide social club that supports and develops undergraduate visual artists at Carolina — regardless of their enrollment in art classes — and strengthens the impact of visual art in the University community. The Studio Art Majors Association (SAMA) is aimed at developing community and professional opportunities that augment the experience for studio art majors and minors, especially through programming of the SAMple Gallery in the Hanes Art Center. ArtHeels is a service-based organization that is passionate about bringing arts (visual, performing, and literary) to the healthcare setting. The Art History Liaisons is the undergraduate art history group. Kappa Pi is the department majors' honors society which includes both studio and art history majors. These groups serve as an important link between the majors and the department's administration.

There are also two faculty-led study abroad programs in the department — Art on the Camino de Santiago in Spain and the Florence/Venice Biennale Summer Program in Italy. Students should discuss their study abroad plans with the undergraduate advisor in studio art to obtain prior approval for courses taken abroad. Basically, courses that have an equivalent in the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum usually are approved. Courses that fall outside the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The actual degree plan may differ depending on the course of study selected (second major, minor, etc.). Students should meet with their academic advisor to create a degree plan that is specific and unique to their interests. The sample plans represented in this catalog are intended for first-year students entering UNC–Chapel Hill in the fall term. Some courses may not be offered every term.

The Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies requires that all students with prior knowledge of a language take a placement test. The beginning language course at UNC is decided by the placement (not by test credit or transfer credit). Almost all language courses are only offered in fall or spring, but not both. Some languages are sometimes offered in summer. 2 No more than one FY-SEMINAR course may be taken or count toward the major. 3 This major has a lot of flexibility and courses for it are abundant, but it also has several specific (and potentially overlapping) requirements that must be met, and more course offerings available in some areas than others. Careful course planning is important to make sure all the requirements are being met. Students are also strongly encouraged to start taking the required language courses in their first semester. Departmental advising is required every fall, and available throughout the year. 4 One language course above 204 may be counted as one of the eight required major courses. Students who wish to pursue further language study may be interested in combining a language minor with this major.',\n",

       " \"Asian Studies Major, B.A.–Arab Cultures Concentration (ARAB): As the fifth most widely spoken language in the world, as one of the official languages of the United Nations, and as the religious language of Muslims who make up a quarter of the world's population, Arabic is a language with a rich literary and cultural heritage and considerable contemporary significance. Speakers of Arabic learn two forms of the language: a formal form, often called Modern Standard Arabic, which is used for official communication such as speeches and most writing; and an informal form that is used primarily in conversation.\\xa0 Because Arabic is spoken across a culturally and geographically varied region stretching from Western Asia across North Africa, there are many dialects of spoken Arabic. Students in Arabic courses at UNC learn both Modern Standard Arabic and a dialect of spoken Arabic (either Egyptian or Levantine) simultaneously. The Arab world has a long and rich history that has always intersected with the histories of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Its geopolitical significance in the modern era, as well as the radical transformations that are occurring in the region since the 2011 Arab revolutions, make the study of the Arab world and its cultures key to understanding the world today. Arab Cultures majors study the literature and visual culture of the Arab world, as well as social practices and intellectual debates through rich course offerings in English.\",\n",

       " \"Asian Studies Major, B.A.–Chinese Concentration (CHIN): Globally, China occupies a prominent position in many respects. With 1.4 billion inhabitants, it is the most populous country in the world. It spans five time zones, has a surface area roughly the size of the United States, and its economy is projected to become the world's largest before the end of this decade. China is the place of origin of one of the oldest cultural traditions in the world, with written records dating back more than three thousand years. Many elements of the traditional cultures of neighboring East Asian countries (such as Vietnam, Korea, and Japan) can be traced back to China. Finally, rapid economic development over the past few decades has bolstered China's political and military aspirations to become a global superpower. A knowledge of Chinese language and culture will enable students to explore the long and complex history of China and better understand China's role in the 21st century. The Chinese program offers an extensive array of courses in Chinese (Mandarin) language, premodern and modern Chinese and Sinophone literature, history, philosophy, society, and film. This allows students to satisfy foreign language requirements, major or minor in Chinese, or complete a Chinese track M.A. degree. Students benefit from one of the strongest Chinese language curriculum programs in the country and extensive resources, including advanced courses in Chinese, language- intensive study abroad opportunities, Chinese library resources, the Chinese Undergraduate Student Association, the Chinese Living-Learning Residential Community, the student-led Duke–UNC China Leadership Summit, and the Chinese Language Table.

It is a unique country where five thousand years of history and tradition coexist with the most advanced technological and economic development. It is also a place where political and ideological differences divide the country into two Koreas (Republic of Korea, or South Korea, and Democratic Republic of Korea, or North Korea) that maintain one of the world's most fortified military zones. The Korean peninsula is home to over 72 million ethnic Koreans (North and South combined) and over 1.3 million recent migrants from all over the world. Approximately 7 million ethnic Koreans have migrated to other countries and have established diasporic communities in over 150 countries. The Korean language is spoken by over 75 million people around the world and ranks 13th among the most used languages in the world. One of the first programs of its kind in the Southeast, the Korean Studies concentration in the Asian Studies degree allows students to combine Korean language study with an interdisciplinary set of courses in Korean culture, history, and society.\",\n",

       " \"Asian Studies Major, B.A.–South Asian Studies Concentration: South Asia refers to a geographic region comprising the nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. With strong cultural ties to the region, Iran, Myanmar, and Tibet are also sometimes considered part of South Asia. Some 5,000 years ago, the highly developed Indus Valley Civilization developed along the Indus River system in present-day Pakistan and northwest India. Over the course of its history, South Asia has been divided into various polities, but in the premodern period experienced significant political consolidation under the Mauryas, the Guptas, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, and the Marathas. Across South Asia there is vast cultural diversity, with its many regional languages and scripts, distinctive and beautiful styles of vernacular literature/poetry, arts, architecture, performance/theatre, music, and dance. South Asia is the birthplace of several world religions, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Islam is another world religion found in South Asia, and Sufism, in particular, has flourished there. Pakistan, Indian, and Bangladesh together are home to about 30 percent of the world's Muslim population. Courses in this concentration span various time periods and cultural forms, although many are situated in the modern period and emphasize literature, film, and/or performance. A degree in Asian Studies with a South Asian Studies concentration will provide students with cultural and language competencies that will serve them well in a globalizing world. Many students usefully combine the degree with another major and/or minor, making them more attractive on the job market, and positioning them well for further study in professional or graduate school.\",\n",

It spans five time zones, has a surface area roughly the size of the United States, and its economy is projected to become the world's largest before the end of this decade. China is the place of origin of one of the oldest cultural traditions in the world, with written records dating back more than three thousand years. Many elements of the traditional cultures of neighboring East Asian countries (such as Vietnam, Korea, and Japan) can be traced back to China. Finally, rapid economic development over the past few decades has bolstered China's political and military aspirations to become a global superpower. A knowledge of Chinese language and culture will enable students to explore the long and complex history of China and better understand China's role in the 21st century. The Chinese program offers an extensive array of courses in the Chinese (Mandarin) language, premodern and modern Chinese and Sinophone literature, history, philosophy, society, and film. This allows students to satisfy foreign language requirements, major or minor in Chinese, or complete a Chinese track M.A. degree. Students benefit from one of the strongest Chinese language curriculum programs in the country and extensive resources, including advanced courses in Chinese, language- intensive study abroad opportunities, Chinese library resources, the Chinese Undergraduate Student Association, the Chinese Living-Learning Residential Community, the student-led Duke-UNC China Leadership Summit, and the Chinese Language Table.\",\n",

       " \"Modern Hebrew Minor (HEBR): Hebrew is one of the world's oldest languages still spoken today. It was similar in origin to ancient Phoenician and developed into an independent language in the 12th century BCE. Hebrew was the spoken language of the Patriarchs during the Biblical period, and the Bible is written in Hebrew. While Aramaic, which utilizes the same alphabet, replaced Hebrew as the spoken language for centuries, Hebrew remained a language used for ritual, prayer, literature, and written communication. As a spoken language, Modern Hebrew began to emerge in the late 19th century and became, in 1913, the official language of instruction in Jewish schools in the region of Palestine. In 1948, Hebrew (along with Arabic) became the official language of the modern state of Israel.\",\n",

       " \"Department of Chemistry (CHEM) (BS, BA, Minor) - Introduction: Chemistry is the scientific study of the composition and properties of matter and the investigation of the laws that govern them. Classically, chemistry is divided into several subdisciplines. Organic chemistry deals primarily with carbon compounds; inorganic chemistry, with compounds of the other elements. Physical chemistry seeks to describe relationships between the chemical and physical properties of all substances. Analytical chemistry studies the analysis of the chemical composition of all substances. Biological chemistry pursues the chemistry of living organisms. At the borders of these subdisciplines are many hybrid areas of study: physical organic, organometallic, bioinorganic, and others. At the interface of chemistry with other sciences, several active fields are fueled by insights gained from two ways of thinking about things: for example, chemical physics, chemical biology, organic geochemistry, and the extensive chemical problems in biotechnology, nanotechnology, material sciences, and molecular medicine. In all of these areas the chemist's approach may be theoretical, experimental, or both. All chemists have a common core of knowledge, learned through a highly structured sequence of undergraduate courses in which the content is divided into the classical subdisciplines. Toward the end of students' progress through their four years of undergraduate study, they may choose to concentrate in one or more areas of chemistry through the courses selected to fulfill the chemistry elective requirements and through undergraduate research.

       " 'Department of Chemistry (CHEM) (BS, BA, Minor) - Advising: Faculty advisors are available in the Department of Chemistry for both walk-in meetings and scheduled advising appointments. The departmental advisors assist students with a variety of areas: course planning for the chemistry major, career/graduate school planning, study abroad opportunities, undergraduate research opportunities, and how to deal with academic difficulties. Chemistry majors are required to meet with a departmental advisor by appointment prior to registering for any semester beyond the fourth term in residence. The faculty advisors also schedule many events for the majors.',\n",
       " \"Department of Chemistry (CHEM) (BS, BA, Minor) - Graduate School and Career Opportunities: An undergraduate degree tailored according to the student's interests can open doors to graduate programs in many academic disciplines: chemistry, environmental science, materials science, polymer science, chemical engineering, geochemistry, chemical physics, and several disciplines at the interface between biology and chemistry. A technically oriented administrator in the chemical industry might choose to obtain a master's degree in business administration. More than 100 schools in the United States offer graduate programs in chemistry and related areas, and the usual practice is to complete a graduate degree at an institution different from the undergraduate institution. It is necessary to specialize in graduate study, either within one of the branches previously mentioned or at the interface between two of them. A student admitted to a graduate program in chemistry in the United States is usually offered a teaching assistantship or fellowship. Chemists have a wide choice of academic, governmental, or industrial positions. By far the greatest percentage accept industrial positions, mostly in chemical manufacturing or the petroleum, food, and pharmaceutical industries, where they may be developing new products to benefit humanity or assessing the level of risk in the processes for some proposed production methods, for example. Most government chemists are employed in agriculture, health, energy, environmental, and defense-related areas. In the academic field, with such a broad spectrum of colleges and universities in this country, chemists can set career goals with varying levels of emphasis on training students in research and teaching in the classroom and instructional laboratory.

       " 'Chemistry Major, B.A. (CHEM) - Special Opportunities in Chemistry - Undergraduate Research: Undergraduates find research to be an exciting and rewarding experience. Undergraduate research can help them acquire a spirit of inquiry, initiative, independence, sound judgment, patience, persistence, alertness, and the ability to use the chemical literature. Undergraduate research also affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses. More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project. The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project involves making direct contact with faculty researchers to inquire about research opportunities. The Chemistry Student Services Office also maintains a list of undergraduate research opportunities. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period. Once a research opportunity is identified, a student will register for CHEM\\xa0395.

       " 'Chemistry Major, B.S.–Polymer Track (CHEM) - Special Opportunities in Chemistry - Undergraduate Research: Undergraduates find research to be an exciting and rewarding experience. Undergraduate research can help them acquire a spirit of inquiry, initiative, independence, sound judgment, patience, persistence, alertness, and the ability to use the chemical literature. Undergraduate research also affords an opportunity to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those usually encountered in standard laboratory courses. More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project. The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project involves making direct contact with faculty researchers to inquire about research opportunities. The Chemistry Student Services Office also maintains a list of undergraduate research opportunities. This process begins well in advance of a preregistration or registration period. Once a research opportunity is identified, a student will register for CHEM\\xa0395.

       " 'Department of City and Regional Planning (PLAN) (BS, BA, Minor) - Introduction: City and regional planning is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to improve the quality of life for people in human settlements. Planners are involved, for example, in forecasting alternative futures of a city or region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness, environmental pollution, and urban decay. City and regional planners work for a variety of public, nonprofit, and private organizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments all employ city and regional planners. In the nonprofit sector, planners work for national, state, and local advocacy groups promoting sustainable development. In the private sector, planners work for development companies and consulting firms. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Undergraduate Catalog  291 For undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the department for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning processes, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different aspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work leading to a career in planning.

The program consists of two courses, CLAS\\xa0691H and CLAS\\xa0692H, taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS\\xa0691H involves a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area of the student's interest and is conducted under the supervision of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral examination by the student's thesis committee. A grade for CLAS\\xa0691H is assigned on the basis of the total semester's work. CLAS\\xa0692H entails the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a final oral defense before the candidate's committee. This body, in turn, reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit, highest honors is made.\",\n",

Graduate study is characterized by intensive participation in seminars, original research and creative activities, and close work with individual faculty members. Students are also prepared for advanced study in related academic disciplines such as law. The career outlook for students with degrees in communication studies is promising, and graduates enter a variety of professions that value communication knowledge and skills. Communication studies majors are prepared to serve as communication specialists in business; in federal, state, and local governments and agencies; and in public service. Some of the specific areas in which majors pursue careers are teaching, social advocacy, nonprofit leadership and management, public relations and advertising, personnel management and training, management consulting, video and film production, and work with emerging technologies. According to the Federal Bureau of Labor, overall employment in media and communication occupations is projected to grow\\xa06 percent by 2031, resulting in 68,600 currently non-existing jobs over the decade. About 115,800 jobs are projected each year. The median annual salary for media and communication professionals was $62,340 in May 2021, which was higher than the median annual salary for all occupations of $45,760. An understanding of communication provides a strong base for a range of career options. The mission of the department is to go beyond narrow technical training by providing a liberal arts approach to communication. This provides the student with maximum latitude for promotion and advancement and avoids limited career opportunities resulting from narrow approaches to the field.

Majors receive rigorous training in the foundations of computer science and the relevant mathematics, then have ample opportunity to specialize in advanced courses. Majors can receive credit for practical training as a computing professional through an internship with a company or organization in the computing or information technology fields. Internships typically are paid positions and involve the student working off campus. All internships for credit must be approved in advance. Students interested in pursuing such an internship must submit a learning contract prior to the start of the internship. See the department's website (https://cs.unc.edu/ undergraduate/learning-contracts/) for additional information. Majors who excel in the program also have the opportunity to perform undergraduate research in computer science. Students can receive credit for conducting research that can be applied to the upper division elective requirement for the major and/or may be used as a vehicle for graduating with department honors. Students interested in receiving credit for research must submit a learning contract prior to the start of the semester in which credit is earned.

       " \"Department of Computer Science (COMP) (BS, BA, Minor) - Admission to the Major: The demand for concentrating in a computer science program has grown significantly at UNC–Chapel Hill over the past decade. In order to maintain the quality of educational experiences Carolina students studying computer science deserve, we must restrict the number of students majoring in computer science relative to our faculty size's ability to sustain the programs. Those wishing to concentrate in computer science must be admitted to a major program (B.A. or B.S.). Students are eligible to apply in the spring semester after completing or while currently enrolled in COMP\\xa0210. Students who are admitted to the program continue through the introductory course sequence with COMP\\xa0301 and COMP\\xa0211 and will have access to upper division electives to complete their degree programs. Please see the department's website (https://cs.unc.edu/ undergraduate/cs-admissions/) for the most up-to-date information about the admission to the major process.\",\n",
       " 'Department of Computer Science (COMP) (BS, BA, Minor) - Advising: In addition to general advising through the Academic Advising Program (https://advising.unc.edu/), students can consult designated faculty members within the Department of Computer Science who act as departmental advisors for requirements specific to the major or minor. Beyond course selection, advisors are also available for discussing internships, study abroad in computer science, honors projects, and undergraduate research opportunities.

      "Physics Major, B.A. (PHYS) None None Everything around you is influenced or governed by physics — the study of matter, energy, and their interactions with one another. Physics seeks to understand the way the universe \"works,\" from the smallest neutrinos to the structure of the cosmos. It is the foundation of all other natural sciences, including chemistry, biology, oceanography, geography, and radiography. The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers six B.A. and two B.S. degree tracks: • B.A. Tracks • Physics • Astronomy • Computational Physics • Energy • Medical and Biological Physics • Quantitative Finance • B.S. Tracks • Physics  • Astrophysics Consider a B.A. degree if you're interested in physics but want to apply your training toward a wider variety of career paths after graduation. Students who completed this program have launched careers as lab researchers, application engineers, data scientists, and financial analysts, among other occupations. Some have also pursued an advanced degree in physics, medical physics, business, law, or computer science. Consider a B.S. degree if you intend to pursue graduate study in physics, astronomy, or a related field, or a career practicing physics.
