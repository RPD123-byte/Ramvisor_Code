- Electives and focus capacity courses should be chosen based on the individual's interests.
- This schedule assumes no Advanced Placement (AP) credits or transfer credits.
- The mix of classes manages workload by balancing core major, focus capacity, and elective courses each semester.

Please consult your academic advisor for a personalized schedule that takes into account your current academic standing, any AP credits, or personal preferences.
