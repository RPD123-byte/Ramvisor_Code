The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H, taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area of the student's interest and is conducted under the supervision of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral examination by the student's thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H is assigned on the basis of the total semester's work. CLAS 692H entails the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a final oral defense before the candidate's committee. This body, in turn, reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit, highest honors is made.\n",

      "Media and Journalism Major, B.A. (MEJO) - Requirements - Requirements in Both Study Areas: The degree earned is a bachelor of arts in media and journalism. Two areas of study are offered: a concentration in advertising/public relations and a concentration in journalism. Areas of study are not noted on the diploma. Some courses are required for all majors in the school, and each area of study has specific course requirements. Students must complete a minimum of 39 credits in media and journalism with a grade point average of 2.0 or better. A grade of C- or less in a MEJO course will not be counted in the minimum number of media and journalism credits required for graduation; the course must be retaken if it is required for the major. If the course is not specifically required, then another course that meets the requirement the first course was meeting may be taken in its stead. During a student's senior year, they must complete a capstone course specific to their area of study. MEJO 393 cannot be counted in the minimum of 39 credit hours required but will count in the total 120-credit hours required by the University. Additionally, students must complete a minimum of six credits to satisfy the school's government/politics as well as ethical and civic values requirements. The school will normally accept only six credit hours of media and journalism courses taken at other institutions. The school typically does not accept transfer credit for MEJO 153. More than perhaps any other field, media and journalism requires a strong foundation in word usage, grammar, punctuation, and other writing skills. Students must score at least 70 percent on the school's usage and grammar examination as a condition for graduation. The examination is administered several times throughout the academic year as well as during the summer. Students are responsible for monitoring their Tar Heel Tracker and are encouraged to consult with an adviser in the school at least once a semester to ensure that they are on track to fulfill all graduation requirements.  Specific information about graduation requirements, advising, registration, and other procedures is also available on the school's website (http://hussman.unc.edu/). The school cannot guarantee that courses needed to satisfy a student's degree requirements will be offered during summer school. Students who plan to complete degree requirements in summer school should be aware that low enrollments sometimes force the school to cancel certain courses or sections during either or both summer sessions.

The philosophy that guides the school is that journalists and communicators must understand the political, social, economic, and cultural forces that operate within society. For this reason, students acquire a background in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences while preparing themselves for journalism and media careers.\n",
      "Translation and Interpreting Minor: Developments in globalization, international trade, worldwide communication and technology have dramatically increased the demand for qualified translators and interpreters in all realms, especially in business, technology, communication, marketing, advertisement, government, healthcare, social services, national security, international trade, and law.

      "Media and Journalism Major, B.A. (MEJO) - Requirements - Requirements in Both Study Areas: The degree earned is a bachelor of arts in media and journalism. Two areas of study are offered: a concentration in advertising/public relations and a concentration in journalism. Areas of study are not noted on the diploma. Some courses are required for all majors in the school, and each area of study has specific course requirements. Students must complete a minimum of 39 credits in media and journalism with a grade point average of 2.0 or better. A grade of C- or less in a MEJO course will not be counted in the minimum number of media and journalism credits required for graduation; the course must be retaken if it is required for the major. If the course is not specifically required, then another course that meets the requirement the first course was meeting may be taken in its stead. During a student's senior year, they must complete a capstone course specific to their area of study. MEJO 393 cannot be counted in the minimum of 39 credit hours required but will count in the total 120-credit hours required by the University. Additionally, students must complete a minimum of six credits to satisfy the school's government/politics as well as ethical and civic values requirements. The school will normally accept only six credit hours of media and journalism courses taken at other institutions. The school typically does not accept transfer credit for MEJO 153. More than perhaps any other field, media and journalism requires a strong foundation in word usage, grammar, punctuation, and other writing skills. Students must score at least 70 percent on the school's usage and grammar examination as a condition for graduation. The examination is administered several times throughout the academic year as well as during the summer. Students are responsible for monitoring their Tar Heel Tracker and are encouraged to consult with an adviser in the school at least once a semester to ensure that they are on track to fulfill all graduation requirements.  Specific information about graduation requirements, advising, registration, and other procedures is also available on the school's website (http://hussman.unc.edu/). The school cannot guarantee that courses needed to satisfy a student's degree requirements will be offered during summer school. Students who plan to complete degree requirements in summer school should be aware that low enrollments sometimes force the school to cancel certain courses or sections during either or both summer sessions.

The philosophy that guides the school is that journalists and communicators must understand the political, social, economic, and cultural forces that operate within society. For this reason, students acquire a background in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences while preparing themselves for journalism and media careers.\n",
      "Translation and Interpreting Minor: Developments in globalization, international trade, worldwide communication and technology have dramatically increased the demand for qualified translators and interpreters in all realms, especially in business, technology, communication, marketing, advertisement, government, healthcare, social services, national security, international trade, and law. The current demand for translation and interpreting professionals outweighs the supply available. This program will provide students the background in theory, technical resources, research skills, and literary and cultural competency that are necessary to communicate in more than one language and in written and oral form. Successful translators and interpreters work for an agency, as independent contractors, or as part of a larger team in national or international organizations, institutions, or associations.

Ensure to maintain a friendly and supportive tone. If the query pertains to a specific major or course, include relevant course codes and prerequisites. If the query is about registration, provide the necessary steps and mention the registration office contact info for further assistance. If you don't know the correct answer refer the user to the unc website for more information. Use the information in the files to format new answers. For example, if asked for a 4 year plan for the physics BS, search for relevant information in the files and find it yourself. It's important to remember that each course gives a certain amount of credit hours. When asked to give a plan on what courses to take, you should check all the gen ed requirements and major requiremenents for a given major and create a plan where the credit hours for the courses add up to under 18 and over 12. Also everytime you list a course in a response, also list the credit hours for the course. These are all the required gen eds that all students must complete before received their degree: College Thriving (IDST 101)\n",

    "Every plan you give should have a course that satisfies all these gen ed requirements. Remember these requirements I gave you above aren't actual courses, they're just thte names of the requirements. There are courses that satisfy these requirements. Find the courses that can satisfy these requirements in the knowledge base. If a plan is requested then it should complete both the major requirements and the gen ed requirements. If the plan only has 3 gen eds obviously it wouldn't be sufficient to graduate with that plan as all gen eds would be required to graduate. Also remember for a plan one of the biggest things you should take into account is prerequisites. The plan shouldn't suggest you to take some course before the prerequisite is completed. For example Phys 118 has to be taken before 119 so you shouldn't suggest to take both in the same semester or 119 before 118. Also make sure that tha plan contains absolutely all of the major requirements. Don't leave any out at all because that messes up the entire schedule. The most important thing is that if my question doesn't mention any sort of plan then don't talk about a plan. Remeber to always give examples. So for example, if a question is asked about what classes can fulfill a first year foundations then you would give the gen eds that fulfill it and examples of each.\n",
