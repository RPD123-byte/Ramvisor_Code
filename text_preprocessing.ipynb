We at the University acknowledge that we face ongoing challenges to overcome the effects and influences of adverse historical, social, political, and economic factors. A critical element for any 21st century educational institution is a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that functions in a global context. The historical, political, economic, and educational backgrounds of the University, the state, and the nation shape our present circumstances and inform the measures we must take to accomplish our highest aspirations. The University engages in teaching, research, and service to expand and discover knowledge, promote educational enlightenment, and improve understanding. We work to assure that we have a complement of students, faculty, and staff that broadly reflects the ways in which people differ. We speak of these differences as representing “diversity.” UNC’s commitment to inclusive excellence began in the 1960s through the support of minority programming and continues today through the work of the the University Ofﬁce for Diversity and Inclusion (UODI) (http://diversity.unc.edu). The ofﬁce is led by the vice provost for equity and inclusion, who serves as the chief diversity ofﬁcer and advises the University community on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and issues. The ofﬁce collaborates with University ofﬁcers and campus units to identify and implement the tenets of the Strategic Plan;  Carolina Next: Innovations for Public Good .
